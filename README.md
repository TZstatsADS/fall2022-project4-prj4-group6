+ Project summary: In this project, we are comparing two methodologies introduced by [A2-Maximizing accuracy under fairness constraints (C-SVM and C-LR)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1507.05259) and [A7-Information Theoretic Measures for Fairness-aware Feature selection (FFS)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.00772) to obtain a better understanding of the trade-off between accuracy and fairness. The criterion we use to quantify fairness is calibration, meaning that the prediction accuracy of the protected group ought to be equal to the accuracy of the unprotected group.
